        "## **Program's Purpose**\n",
        "This program demonstrates the Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) algorithm. LWR is a non-parametric method used to fit a curve to data points without assuming a specific functional form (like linear or polynomial). It works by giving more weight to data points near the point of prediction and less weight to those farther away. This allows it to capture local patterns in the data and create a flexible fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Inference**\n",
        "The program aims to infer the relationship between the total bill and the tip amount in a restaurant setting. It uses the LWR algorithm to model this relationship, essentially creating a curve that shows how the tip amount tends to change as the total bill increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that LWR doesn't establish a causal relationship; it simply describes the observed pattern. It doesn't tell us that a higher bill causes a higher tip, but rather that they tend to occur together.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Input**\n",
        "The input to the program is the 'tips' dataset, which is loaded using Seaborn. This dataset likely contains information about restaurant bills, including the total bill amount and the tip amount for each transaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, the program uses the 'total_bill' column as the input feature (x) and the 'tip' column as the output or target variable (y).\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Output**\n",
        "The program produces two main outputs:\n",
        "\n",
        "A fitted LWR model: This model is represented by the lwr function and the calculated regression coefficients (beta). It captures the relationship between the total bill and the tip amount based on the data.\n",
        "A visualization: The program generates a scatter plot showing the original data points (total bill vs. tip) and a red line representing the fitted LWR curve. This plot helps visualize the relationship captured by the model.\n",
        "In essence, the program takes a dataset of restaurant bills as input, uses LWR to learn a model of the relationship between the total bill and tip amount, and then visualizes this relationship using a plot. This allows us to see how tips tend to vary with the total bill amount, without making strong assumptions about the underlying functional form of this relationship.\n",
